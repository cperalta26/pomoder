## Why did you build this?
I built a pomodoro timer because I wanted to learn more about using CSS-in-JS to style React components. Using the Styled-Components library and its docs allowed me to easily learn how CSS-in-JS can be beneficial. In addition, finding the pomodoro technique useful, I decided to build my own to share with everyone in order to help others improve their productivity. Pomoder has 3 countdown times -- 25 minutes (Pomodoro button), 10 minutes (Long Break button), and 5 minutes (Short Break). The Start button starts the timer while the Stop button stops the timer. The Reset button resets the time to the last timer used.

## What can improve?
* I need to make my code more DRY.
* Add vendor prefixes.
* Handle 404 Errors better.
